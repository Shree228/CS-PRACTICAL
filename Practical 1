Experiment No: 1 
Problem Statement: 
In an e-commerce system, customer account IDs are stored in a list, and you are tasked with 
writing a program that implements the following: - Linear Search: Check if a particular customer account ID exists in the list. - Binary Search: Implement binary search to find if a customer account ID exists, improving 
the search efficiency over the basic linear search. 
Objective: 
To write a C program to implement Linear Search and Binary Search for checking the 
existence of customer account IDs in a list. 
Software Requirements: - Operating System: Windows / Linux - IDE: Code::Blocks / Turbo C / Dev C++ - Compiler: GCC Compiler 
Hardware Requirements: - Processor: Intel Pentium or later - RAM: Minimum 2 GB - Hard Disk: Minimum 500 MB free space - Input Device: Keyboard - Output Device: Monitor 
Theory: 
Linear Search: 
Linear Search is a simple and straightforward technique used to find an element in a list. In 
this method, we sequentially check each element in the list until the desired element is 
found or the end of the list is reached. 
It does not require the list to be sorted and is easy to implement but not very efficient for 
large datasets. 
Example: 
To find ID 110 in the list [101, 105, 110, 115, 120], Linear Search checks each element from 
left to right until it finds 110. 
Time Complexity: 
- Best Case: O(1) - Worst Case: O(n) 
Binary Search: 
Binary Search is a much faster technique compared to linear search but requires the list to 
be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the list into two halves and narrowing down the 
search space based on comparisons. This significantly reduces the number of comparisons 
needed to find the target value. 
Example: 
To find ID 110 in the sorted list [101, 105, 110, 115, 120], Binary Search checks the middle 
element, and then halves the list until 110 is found. 
Time Complexity: - Best Case: O(1) - Worst Case: O(log n) 
Algorithm: 
Linear Search Algorithm: 
1. Start from index 0 and move through each element. 
2. If the current element equals the target, return found. 
3. If end of list is reached, return not found. 
Binary Search Algorithm: 
1. Set low = 0, high = n-1. 
2. While low <= high: - Calculate mid = (low + high)/2 - If arr[mid] == key, return found - Else if key < arr[mid], set high = mid - 1 - Else, set low = mid + 1 
3. If not found, return not found 
C Program Code: 
#include <stdio.h> 
int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int key) { 
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
if(arr[i] == key) 
return i; 
} 
return -1; 
} 
int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int key) { 
int low = 0, high = n - 1; 
while(low <= high) { 
int mid = (low + high) / 2; 
if(arr[mid] == key) 
return mid; 
else if(key < arr[mid]) 
high = mid - 1; 
else 
low = mid + 1; 
} 
return -1; 
} 
int main() { 
int arr[100], n, key, choice, result; 
printf("Enter number of customer IDs: "); 
scanf("%d", &n); 
printf("Enter %d customer account IDs (in sorted order for Binary Search):\n", n); 
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
scanf("%d", &arr[i]); 
printf("Enter customer ID to search: "); 
scanf("%d", &key); 
printf("Choose search method:\n1. Linear Search\n2. Binary Search\n"); 
scanf("%d", &choice); 
if(choice == 1) 
result = linearSearch(arr, n, key); 
else 
result = binarySearch(arr, n, key); 
if(result != -1) 
printf("Customer ID found at position %d\n", result );  
else 
printf("Customer ID not found.\n"); 
return 0; 
} 
Conclusion: 
Successfully implemented Linear and Binary Search algorithms in C to search customer 
account IDs in a list. Binary search provides better performance on sorted data compared to 
linear search.
