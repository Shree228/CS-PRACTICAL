Experiment No.: 2 
Problem Statement: 
In a company, employee salaries are stored in a list as floating-point numbers. Write a 
Python program that sorts the employee salaries in ascending order using the following two 
algorithms: - Selection Sort: Sort the salaries using the selection sort algorithm. - Bubble Sort: Sort the salaries using the bubble sort algorithm. 
After sorting the salaries, the program should display the top five highest salaries in the 
company. 
Objective: 
To understand and implement the working of Selection Sort and Bubble Sort in C to sort a 
list of employee salaries (floating-point values) and retrieve the top five highest salaries. 
Theory: 
Selection Sort: 
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that selects the smallest (or largest) element 
from an unsorted array and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element. It continues until 
the entire array is sorted. - Time Complexity: O(n²) - Space Complexity: O(1) - Stable: No 
Bubble Sort: 
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs, and swaps them if 
they are in the wrong order. It gets its name because smaller values "bubble" to the top of 
the list. - Time Complexity: O(n²) - Space Complexity: O(1) 
Software Requirements: - OS: Windows / Linux - IDE: Code:Blocks / Turbo C / VS Code - Compiler: GCC 
Hardware Requirements: - CPU: Intel Pentium or above - RAM: 512 MB or more - Disk: 100 MB free space 
 
 
C Program : 
#include <stdio.h> 
  
void selectionSort(float arr[], int n) { 
    int i, j, minIndex; 
    float temp; 
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { 
        minIndex = i; 
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) { 
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) 
                minIndex = j; 
        } 
        temp = arr[minIndex]; 
        arr[minIndex] = arr[i]; 
        arr[i] = temp; 
    } 
} 
  
void bubbleSort(float arr[], int n) { 
    int i, j; 
    float temp; 
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { 
        for (j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) { 
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) { 
                temp = arr[j]; 
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1]; 
                arr[j + 1] = temp; 
            } 
        } 
    } 
} 
  
void displaySorted(float arr[], int n) { 
    int i; 
    printf("\nSorted Salaries (Ascending Order):\n"); 
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
        printf("%.2f\n", arr[i]); 
    } 
} 
  
void displayTopFive(float arr[], int n) { 
    int i, count = 0; 
    printf("\nTop five highest salaries:\n"); 
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0 && count < 5; i--, count++) { 
        printf("%.2f\n", arr[i]); 
    } 
} 
  
int main() { 
    int n, i, choice; 
    float salaries[100], sorted[100]; 
  
    printf("Enter the number of employees: "); 
    scanf("%d", &n); 
  
    printf("Enter the salaries of %d employees:\n", n); 
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
        scanf("%f", &salaries[i]); 
        sorted[i] = salaries[i];  // Copy original data 
    } 
  
    printf("\nChoose sorting method:\n"); 
    printf("1. Selection Sort\n"); 
    printf("2. Bubble Sort\n"); 
    printf("Enter your choice: "); 
    scanf("%d", &choice); 
  
    if (choice == 1) { 
        selectionSort(sorted, n); 
        printf("\nSalaries sorted using Selection Sort.\n"); 
    } else if (choice == 2) { 
        bubbleSort(sorted, n); 
        printf("\nSalaries sorted using Bubble Sort.\n"); 
    } else { 
printf("Invalid choice!\n"); 
return 1; 
} 
displaySorted(sorted, n); 
displayTopFive(sorted, n); 
return 0; 
} 
Conclusion: 
In this experiment, we successfully implemented both Selection Sort and Bubble Sort 
algorithms in C to sort a list of employee salaries. After sorting, we extracted the top five 
highest salaries by accessing the last five elements of the sorted list. - Selection Sort and Bubble Sort are easy to understand and implement. - Though inefficient for large datasets due to O(n²) time complexity, they are ideal 
for demonstrating basic sorting principles. - The program correctly identifies and displays the top five highest salaries in both approaches.
